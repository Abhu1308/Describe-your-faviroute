        <h3>
            <p>Coding is used to make app`s and website`s . People those master coding can make any app or website they want . Coding has many languages like: HTML,CSS,Javascript,Python etc.If dragging blocks that means that you are that you are not at the real coding yet it means that you are training right now of the code that you`ll be writing in the future . Some platforms that will allow you drag and drop are:code.org,Thunkable etc.Platforms that will allow you to type the code are:CodePen.io,Code.org,Notepad,Brackets the platform using which I made this website etc.I am a Whitehat student so in Whitehat in which level`s are presented as hat`s so I am on red hat which means I am on lvl 5.There are 8 lvls in total the hat`s are:lvl 1 green hat , lvl 2 brown hat , lvl 3 yellow hat , lvl 4 blue hat , lvl 5 red hat , lvl 6 orange hat , lvl 7 purple hat , lvl 8 white hat which is the final lvl but you can still take more classes to learn more coding.</p>
